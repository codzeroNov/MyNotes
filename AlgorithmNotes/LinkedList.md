When you get to solve a linked list, the first approach you should concern about:

1. Break the linked list in the middle, revert it.
2. Sometimes we can use stack to read a linked list in reverse order.
3. When it comes to **deep copy** a linked list. Try to double the nodes in the original list, and then extract the new nodes out.
4. Fast pointer & slow pointer.
